# "codepage" determines which windows ANSI codepage you expect clients to be using.
# Since SA-MP works with ANSI, and mono/.NET works with UTF, we need to translate all text.
# The default codepage is 1250, if you wish to change this, change the following line to
# your preferred codepage. Available codepages are: 1250,1251,1252,1253,1254,1255,1256,

# "symbols" determines the files for which symbol files should be
# generated before loading the plugin. This is only available on windows!
# When building on linux (using xbuild), symbol files are already generated.
# When buildling on windows and the binaries are copied to a linux machine, 
# generate the symbol files by running the server once on a windows machine
# using this "symbols" option. You can also build a .mdb symbol file
# from a .pdb file on linux using (mono-root)/lib/mono/4.5/pdb2mdb.exe
# 
# format: symbols [file1] [file2] [...]

samp-monoproxy
==============

MonoProxy for SA:MP allows SA:MP GameModes to be written in C# and to be executed using Mono on Winows/Linux.

This project is still under construction and has not yet been tested on Linux.

Some functions/parts may give problems, crash or not may not even compile.

I'm a total C++ newb and all feedback is welcome, file an Issue or contact me on the SA-MP forums.

TODO's
======
-Not all natives have been implemented. Only all <a_players-decl.h> and <a_samp-decl.h> natives and callbacks have been implemented so far. <a_http-decl.h>, <a_objects-decl.h> and <a_vehicles-decl.h> have not yet been implemented. <a_http-decl.h> may never be implemented, since it's easier to use .NET's functions instead.
-Change Position to Vector class.
-Add more documentary.

SampSharp
======
SampSharp for SA:MP allows SA:MP GameModes to be written in C# and to be executed using Mono on Winows/Linux.

This project is still under construction and has not yet been tested on Linux.

Some functions/parts may give problems, crash or not may not even compile.

I'm a total C++ newb (but awesome with c# ![](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/e/330) ) and all feedback is welcome, file an Issue or contact me on the SA-MP forums.

__Notice__
On 28-12-2014 I've removed the mono binaries and some old files from the git history. Download the mono binaries from http://deploy.timpotze.nl/packages/mono-portable.zip and store them inside the /environment folder if you are running SampSharp on windows.

SampSharp
-------------

SA-MP# is a plugin and library that allows you to write San Andreas: Multiplayer(SA-MP) gamemodes in C# and VB. SA-MP#'s aim is to allow you to enjoy all features of OO-programming and .NET. SA-MP# uses the [Mono Framework] to allow linux servers to run this plugin as well. For information about installing and building SA-MP#, check the wiki.

All feedback is welcome, file an Issue or contact me on the SA-MP forums:<br/>

Note of Caution
-------------

- I've only tested SA-MP# on a 32-bit ubuntu linux machine. Altough it should work on other linux distros, I can't guarantee that it does.
- **Be aware!** Mono is not **fully** compatible with all of .NET's features. Check [their website](http://www.mono-project.com/Compatibility) for more details.
- EntityFramework does not seem to be compatible with mono/SA-MP#! Instead, use NHibernate, which is just ase awesome as EntityFramework (if not more awesome). See src/NHibernateTest for an example of how to use NHibernate. For a why and how EF does not work with SA-MP#, see [#24](https://github.com/ikkentim/SampSharp/issues/24).

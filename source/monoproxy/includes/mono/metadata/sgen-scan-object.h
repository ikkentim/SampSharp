 *
 * Scans one object, using the OBJ_XXX macros.  The start of the
 * object must be given in the variable "char* start".  Afterwards,
 * "start" will point to the start of the next object, if the scanned
 * object contained references.  If not, the value of "start" should
 * be considered undefined after executing this code.
 *
 * Modifiers (automatically undefined):
 *
 * SCAN_OBJECT_NOSCAN - if defined, don't actually scan the object,
 * i.e. don't invoke the OBJ_XXX macros.
 *
 * SCAN_OBJECT_ACTION - is invoked after an object has been scanned.
 * The object's start is "start", its length in bytes (including
 * padding at the end) is "skip_size".  "desc" is the object's GC
 * descriptor.  The action can use the macro
 * "SCAN" to scan the object.
 *
 * SCAN_OBJECT_NOVTABLE - desc is provided by the includer, instead of
 * vt.  Complex arrays cannot not be scanned.
